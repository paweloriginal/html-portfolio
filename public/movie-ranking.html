<h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Forrest Gump is a heartwarming tearjerker about a guy whose big heart more than makes up for his low IQ. Its also a story of how success has a way of finding the good and bypassing the evil. These are the reasons that Forrest Gump is one of the most popular and most iconic.

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>Avada Kedavra!!!</p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>It teaches you to love yourself despite how you look. While most of our traditional folktales portray the message that goodness equates beauty, Shrek turns this notion around by depicting the ogres as the genuine beauties.</p>
